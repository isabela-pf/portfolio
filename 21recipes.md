# 21 Recipes Cookbook
###### Editorial Design, Design System, Photography

![header]()

A collection of recipes from 21 third year graphic design students at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 20 Recipes from California (and 1 from Virginia) highlights the stories and significance of the recipe to the student. I especially wanted to showcase the geography of the unique combination of recipes, exploring what food is being made where.This project was selected for Cal Poly’s 2019 Juried Student Show.

## Design System
To create a consistent experience across more than 70 pages, a solid design system was needed. This wasn't only a matter of colors and text and imagery, but how they would interact with each other. All colors used for text match appropriate [WCAG color contrast ratios](https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/)as a part of good accessibility practice.

## Photography
Just as individual stories create a narrative, ingredients create the dish. The photography for this project showcases the ingredients as the start of a culinary journey just as each recipe’s story instigates how it became a part of a someone’s life.
