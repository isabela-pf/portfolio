# About

## I'm a curious creator specializing in digital design. My main experience is in UX/UI and publishing.

I began designing because I wanted a career that would allow for interdisciplinary exploration, so I enjoy working with all the amazing things people do that arenâ€™t just design. I love information, and I love making it accessible to people even more. Strong typography, vibrant colors, and experiences that help people improve their lives are elements I like in design. When I'm not designing, chances are you will find me watering house plants, talking to my cat, or reading comic books.
